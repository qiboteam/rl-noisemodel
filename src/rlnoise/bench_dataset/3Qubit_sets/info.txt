These dataset are all 3 qubit and of lenght 50. 
The letter D in the name of the file specify the depth of each set.
In this folder is also present the file config used to generate them, it can be useful
to see the noise params used for the noise model.
The file are .npz and have two key: "label" that are the dm of the noisy circuits and "clean_rep" that 
are the array representation of the non-noisy circuits.

---Loading the dataset---
Example: 

f = open(bench_dataset_path,"rb")
tmp=np.load(f,allow_pickle=True)
circuit_rep=tmp['clean_rep']
circuit_label=tmp['label']
f.close()
