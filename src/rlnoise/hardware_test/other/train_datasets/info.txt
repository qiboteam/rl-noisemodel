The dataset that starts with "IBM" have as primary gates [X,RZ,CNOT]
The connection between the CNOT are only allowed on neighbour qubits
The dataset contain both the train and evaluation circuits array representations
and they should be loaded as:

dataset = np.load(file, allow_pickle=True)
train_set = dataset["train_set"]
evaluation_set = dataset["val_set"]
