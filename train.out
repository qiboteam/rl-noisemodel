[Qibo 0.2.7|INFO|2024-07-25 10:56:10]: Using qibojit (numba) backend on /CPU:0
/nfs/users/simone.bordoni/rl/lib/python3.10/site-packages/stable_baselines3/ppo/ppo.py:148: UserWarning: You have specified a mini-batch size of 64, but because the `RolloutBuffer` is of size `n_steps * n_envs = 1000`, after every 15 untruncated mini-batches, there will be a truncated mini-batch of size 40
We recommend using a `batch_size` that is a factor of `n_steps * n_envs`.
Info: (n_steps=1000 and n_envs=1)
